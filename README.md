## Game Rules  

Teeko is played in two phases: **Placement Phase** and **Movement Phase**.  

### 1. Placement Phase  
- Players take turns placing their pieces on any empty square of a 5x5 grid.  
- Each player has four pieces, and the phase ends when all eight pieces have been placed on the board.  

### 2. Movement Phase  
- Players take turns moving one of their pieces.  
- A piece can move to any **adjacent square** (orthogonal or diagonal).  
- Pieces cannot jump over other pieces or occupy an already-filled square.

## Winning Conditions  
The game ends when a player achieves one of the following patterns:  
- **Four in a row**: Aligning their four pieces in a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).  
- **Four in a square**: Forming a 2x2 block with their pieces.  

If neither player can achieve a winning pattern, the game continues indefinitely, testing each player's strategy and skills.
